  "response": " The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth, it is made up of different wavelengths or colors, but the short-wavelength light (blue and violet) is scattered in all directions by the molecules in Earth's atmosphere more than other colors because they are smaller than the wavelengths of blue and violet light.\n\nWhile violet light is also scattered, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and we perceive the sky as blue rather than violet. Additionally, ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs much of the violet and ultraviolet light, making it harder for us to see the sky as violet.\n\nAt sunrise or sunset, however, you might observe a red, orange, pink or yellow sky. This happens when the sunlight passes through more particles in the atmosphere (due to Earth's curvature) and is scattered in such a way that it excites the longer wavelength colors like red, orange, and yellow.",
